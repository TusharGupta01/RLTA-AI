    "While Deep Learning Algorithms such as CNN, RNN, LSTM are responsible for recent breakthroughs in problems like computer vision, machine translation and time series prediction – they can also combine with reinforcement learning algorithms to create something as astounding as [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/).\n",

    "Reinforcement learning refers to goal-oriented algorithms, where an agent learns by interating with its environment. The agent then gets rewards based on the actions that it has performed, negative rewards for the actions which are not desirable and positive for the correct/desirable actions. Lets take an example, When an infant plays, perform some gestures in order to interact with its environment, it has no explixit teacher but it does have senses which are interacting with environment. Exercising this connection produces a wealth of information about cause and effect, about the consequences of actions, and about what to do in order to achieve goals. And with such interactions which are undoubtedly a major source of knowledge about our environments and ourselves, we try to achive our goals. "
